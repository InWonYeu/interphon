Welcome to InterPhon's documentation!
=====================================

**InterPhon** is a Python Package for *Ab initio* Interface Phonon Calculations within a 3D Electronic Structure Framework.

It fully implements a set of tools to promote efficient interface phonon calculations and
supports the phonon analysis of symmetry- and periodicity-reduced systems, in conjunction with 3D DFT codes.

Currently supported DFT codes:

1. VASP
2. Quantum ESPRESSO
3. FHI-aims
