"""
InterPhon utility implementations.

This sub-package includes following four modules:

atomic_weight.py -> Dictionary of atomic weight collections.
typing.py -> Defined typing formats of arguments to increase readability.
linear_tetrahedron_method.py -> Function collection of 1D, 2D, and 3D version of linear tetrahedron method.
k_points.py -> Function collection to sample the points in Brillouin Zone.
