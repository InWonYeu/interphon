"""
InterPhon analysis sub-package.

This sub-package consists of following four modules:

dos.py -> dos class to analyze density of states.
band.py -> band to analyze dispersion relation.
mode.py -> mode class to analyze vibrational motions.
thermal_properties.py -> thermal property class to analyze thermodynamic properties such as vibrational entropy.
