## This is the data used to obtain the results in **"Interface: Si(111)/GaAs(111)"** ##

The contents of the DFT output file (`vasprun.xml`) have been deleted except for force-related information to reduce the file size.

The data include following four systems:

1. Si(111)/GaAs(111) I-A-polar(1×1) with **enlargement** = “3 3 1”
2. Si(111)/GaAs(111) I-B-polar(1×1) with **enlargement** = “3 3 1”
3. Si(111)/GaAs(111) II-A-polar(1×1) with **enlargement** = “3 3 1”
4. Si(111)/GaAs(111) II-B-polar(1×1) with **enlargement** = “3 3 1”
