## This is the data used to obtain the results in **"Surface reconstruction: InAs(111)A and (111)B"** ##

The contents of the DFT output file (vasprun.xml) have been deleted except for force-related information to reduce the file size.

The data include following three systems:

1. InAs(111)A In-vacancy(2×2) with **enlargement** = “1 1 1” and “2 2 1”
2. InAs(111)A In-vacancy α(2×2) with **enlargement** = “2 2 1”
3. InAs(111)A In-vacancy β(2×2) with **enlargement** = “2 2 1”
