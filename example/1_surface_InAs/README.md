This is the data used to obtain the results in "Surface reconstruction: InAs(111)A and (111)B"

The data include following three systems:

1. InAs(111)A In-vacancy(2×2) with **enlargement** = “1 1 1”
2. InAs(111)A In-vacancy(2×2) with **enlargement** = “2 2 1”
3. InAs(111)A In-vacancy α(2×2) and In-vacancy β(2×2) with **enlargement** = “2 2 1”
