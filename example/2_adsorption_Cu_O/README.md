## This is the data used to obtain the results in **"Adsorption: Oxygen on Cu(111)"** ##

The contents of the DFT output file (`vasprun.xml`) have been deleted except for force-related information to reduce the file size.

The data include following three systems:

1. Cu(111) pristine(1×1) with **enlargement** = “4 4 1”
2. Cu(111) O-FCC(2×2) with **enlargement** = “2 2 1”
3. Cu(111) O-HCP(2×2) with **enlargement** = “2 2 1”
